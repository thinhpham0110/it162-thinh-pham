        <p>
            The growth and proliferation of internet and computing technology have shifted many operations online, making mobile applications or responsive websites a must-have for any business. Responsive websites cannot be confused with mobile applications as the two terms have very distinct features. First, responsive websites work on all browsers, screens, or platforms, unlike mobile Apps intended for small screens such as tablets and mobile phones. Those businesses looking for customers will prefer responsive websites as they are more service-oriented, have a broader reach, and customers can use different devices and platforms to access their goods, services, and information. Responsive websites require internet connectivity to access the information, unlike most mobile applications designed to carry out different operations even without internet access. Websites do not require users to install or download them as they are readily available via a browser, unlike mobile applications requiring separate installation from the Apps marketplace before viewing their content or receiving services. The websites are also easier to fix bugs and update, as users do not even know when the websites are updating or required to install newly-updated versions, unlike mobile applications that require them to install new versions of the App to fix bugs and may be hard to upgrade them without installing a different version of the App. However, this does not imply that the websites are more secure than mobile applications.

            Websites are also relatively cheaper to design and maintain. They only require domain hosting fees and are generally designed to work on many devices, unlike mobile applications designed to run on specific devices and customized to suit specific users' interests and goals. However, applications can be very useful in dealing with repeated customers as they easily integrate with device tools and features and are designed with efficiency in mind to deliver exemplary service, functionality, speed, and performance needed to guarantee customer satisfaction, create and maintain customer loyalty. They are also preferred in interactive gaming, complex reporting, or calculations with visualization or where push notifications are necessary and very useful. All in all, mobile applications or responsive websites work interchangeably depending on the goals an organization wishes to achieve. It is up to them to make informed decisions on the plan that suits them best.
